# Asilidae

This is Asilidae. It's a bash (unix shell) encrypted, mutant and polymorphic virus that can infect bash files in the same working directory where it is located. The code in each generation changes more than 80 percent.

It was tested on MX Linux and Lubuntu and it works perfectly.

There is no payload so you can test it safely.

It uses standard Linux tools, like cat, sed, head, tail and openssl so they have to be installed in your system if you want to see the virus working.
